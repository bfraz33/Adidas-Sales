# Adidas-Sales
This is another ETL script pulling sales data from an Adidas excel flat file, data source from Kaggle. 
This flat file contains the sales data from 2020 and 2021, I have extracted, transformed and loaded this data into a PostgreSQL data base and placed created the visuals in PowerBI. 

Below is my visualization of the 2020-2021 Adidas sales. Here I have the top products based on sales, most popular retailers in that 2 year time frame that sold adidas products, top 5 states in sales and the two most popular products. To the right I placed some fun fact data and to the left some adidas logos.
